FrameExtraction iOS App
=======================

This app is based on a [tutorial](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/ios-camera-frames-extraction-d2c0f80ed05a) on using Swift and AVFoundation for extracting and displaying frames of the camera in real-time.

The tutorial was written for Swift 3, but this repo is using Swift 4.0

## CocoaPods ##

This project uses CocoaPods to pull in the dependency to OpenCV. A good resource for using cocoapods for opencv, and connecting the C++ library through Objective-C++ into Swift can be found [here](https://blog.kickview.com/opencv-setup-on-ios/).

For a tutorial that does this *without* using CocoaPods, see [here](https://medium.com/@borisohayon/ios-opencv-and-swift-1ee3e3a5735b)
