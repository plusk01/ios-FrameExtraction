FrameExtraction iOS App
=======================

This app is based on a [tutorial](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/ios-camera-frames-extraction-d2c0f80ed05a) on using Swift and AVFoundation for extracting and displaying frames of the camera in real-time.

The tutorial was written for Swift 3, but this repo is using Swift 4.1.
